# SpeedBridge
**SpeedBridge** is an open-sourced plugin that lets your players score a timestamp by bridging from A to B as quickly as possible. This is for people who want to experiment with other bridging techniques, play competitively, or train their bridging skills.

For more information, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Tofpu/SpeedBridge/wiki) page.

## Second iteration
A second iteration of this plugin was introduced with several improvements at [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/speedbridge-v2-bridge-practice-plugin.100619) website. 

Notably, the improvements are as follows:
- Dynamic island generation: set-up the island once, and it will dynamically scale up the islands on demand.
- WorldEdit intregration: point your islands to a schematic and easily update the islands` blocks by restarting.
- Personal blocks: players are now able to open a GUI, and choose their favorite block.  

... and so on.
